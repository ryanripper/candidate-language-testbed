# Regenerating the excluded WS0 artifacts

Four groups of files in this folder are excluded from version control (see the
repository `.gitignore`) because they are large and fully derived. Everything
here is deterministic — same inputs, same seeds, same outputs.

Run from inside `ws0-harness/`:

| Excluded file | Rebuild with | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `blind_corpus.parquet`, `sealed_truth.parquet` | `python 01_seal_corpus.py` | Reads `../data/synthetic-candidate-tweets/synthetic_candidate_tweets_2022.csv.gz`. Also rewrites the committed `seal_manifest.json`; the load-bearing stamp is `source_sha256` (guarded in-script and pinned as a constant in `04_verify_harness.py`) — the parquet hashes can legitimately drift with pandas/pyarrow versions, so a parquet-hash diff alone does not mean a different split. |
| `tweet_split_ab.parquet` | `python 03_build_splits.py` | Seed 20260725. Also rewrites the committed `splits.json`. |
| `baselines/candidate_vectors.npz`, `baselines/D_w2v_raw.npy`, `baselines/D_w2v_corrected.npy`, `baselines/D_tfidf.npy` | `python 02_freeze_baselines.py` | ~10 minutes. Word2vec is retrained single-threaded with a deterministic hashfxn (seed 20260720) — **do not** raise `workers`, it destroys reproducibility. |

Then always:

```bash
python 04_verify_harness.py    # must print HARNESS VERIFIED
```

`04_verify_harness.py` regenerates `baselines/baseline_validation.csv` and checks
it against the frozen 07-20 reference values. If it prints anything other than
HARNESS VERIFIED, the rebuild does not match the artifacts the committed results
were computed from, and downstream numbers should not be compared to the ones in
the write-ups.

**Committed and not regenerable from here:** `baselines/pca_scores.npz`,
`baselines/axis_scores.csv`, `baselines/candidate_metadata.csv`,
`baselines/frozen_validation_20260720.csv`, `baselines/manifest.json`.
